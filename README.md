# dash-blog
Blogging with Dash. Also my personal blog.

---

The idea of this is to create a simple blog engine that takes care of the dirty work for you. 

Each blog post is a small (or large) Dash app page - so it can have all the good stuff included in Dash app development. The user simply adds the app file to the folder of posts and *voila*! it is added as a URL. 

The rest of the backend stuff will be taken care of, including:

- analytics and an analytics dashboard (customizable)
- mobile/desktop view optimization
- user cookie implementation
- post view tracking
- post recommendation
- post navigation
- profile managment (with some simple inputs)
- layout
- theme (just change a config variable)
- SEO (??)
- URL management
- writing markdown posts
- comment section
- caching
- slideshow conversion (mixed concept with [dash-slides](https://github.com/russellromney/dash-slides)?

Hopefully this can be a fun proof of concept for Dash in a non-dashboard or portal way, and also be useful for me to have a POC blog.
